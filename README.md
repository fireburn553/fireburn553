# JAMES CHARLIE I. SALVA

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James Charlie Salva, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in computer science, data science, web development, machine learning, web and mobile development, database, and project development. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I am a graduate of BS in Information Technology from Camarines Norte State College, currently pursuing a BS in Software Development at BYU Idaho. My fascination with learning new technologies drives my career path in software development.

My past experiences have taught me to be flexible, a fast learner, and a motivated team player. During my internship, my team and I developed a web-based ranking system that evaluates municipalities based on submitted documents and criteria satisfaction. As a volunteer at the Philippine Red Cross Camarines Norte Chapter, I managed the data of Red Cross Youth Volunteers as the Red Cross Youth Focal Person.

I am open to project-based development roles, web and mobile development, database management or development, and team leadership positions. Building connections with others who share my passion for technology and development would be incredibly valuable.

In my free time, I volunteer at the Philippine Red Cross Camarines Norte Chapter and enjoy traveling to different places on my motorcycle.
